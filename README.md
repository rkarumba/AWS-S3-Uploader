## How to Get Started 🏁

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Bash (comes pre-installed on most systems)
    *   AWS CLI (installation guide: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
    *   Your AWS credentials ready to rock (environment variables):
        ```bash
        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
        export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your-region>  # Optional, defaults to us-west-1
        ```

2.  **Let's Upload!** 📤
    ```bash
    ./s3_uploader.sh <file_path> <bucket_name>
    ```
    *   Swap `<file_path>` with the path to your awesome file.
    *   Swap `<bucket_name>` with your S3 bucket's name.

## Showcase 📸

```bash
./s3_uploader.sh car_show_footage.zip sweet-car-flicks
